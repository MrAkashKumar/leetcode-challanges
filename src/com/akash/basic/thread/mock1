1. Write a program to print odd even using threads

    How it works:
        1. Shared number starts at 1.
        2. Two threads (oddThread and evenThread) print odd and even numbers respectively.
        3. They take turns using wait() and notify() on a shared lock.
        4. It runs until the number reaches MAX.
        5. Want a version using ReentrantLock, Condition, or semaphores instead?
