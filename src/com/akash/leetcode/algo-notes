@ -why I have used -> Integer.MIN_VALUE 
      - This is a constant in Java that represents the smallest possible integer value in the int data type.
      - starting with Integer.MIN_VALUE ensures that:
           - Any valid product calculated will be greater than this initial value.
           - Even if all numbers in the array are negative or zero, the logic won't break.
           - Alternative approach - instead of you could initialize with 0 but this might fail if all element are negative
           - It’s commonly used in problems involving maximum values, negative values, or boundary conditions.

@ - why I have used -> Integer.MAX_VALUE:
      - this condition use for Boundary Checking
      - when we are finding minimum value then you can use this condition
      - prevents exceeding Java’s integer limit.
      - 



@- why we are using for Arrays.fill(distance, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
      - In algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path, Floyd-Warshall, or Dynamic Programming,
